# Game Structure

- Classic Medieval RPG World

- Towns as Safe Zones
- Outside Towns are combat areas that will spawn mobs that players can kill for xp, loot, etc.

- Inventory System
	- Players have 2 sets of choices when creating a new profile
		- Which race you are: Human, Elf, Dwarf, Druid, Were-beast, Halfling, etc. This will affect in which area of the World you spawn in and your starting stats, skill-tree, etc.
		- Fantasy Realism Level:
			- Equalist: You are equally good at everything (1x multiplier for all dmg)
			- Realist: You can customize how much damage you per dmg type (you can do a lot of fire dmg but no water dmg)
			- Specialist: You can be the best at a certain thing (fighting with a certain attribute) but are absolutely shit at everything else (you can do big DPS but are permanently capped at 5 stamina, etc.)
	- Remnant 2 like stats, where you start of with 4 main stats (strength, intelligence, agility and stamina) and you can gain different stats (via quests, achievements, etc.) and maybe combine them together to get better types of stats

- Combat is based on attack, defense and dodges
	- Doing any action requires stamina (attacking, depending, dodging, running, foraging, smithing, cooking, etc.)
	- Damage dealt and received are of 8 types:
		- Physical
		- Fire
		- Water
		- Wind
		- Earth
		- Nature
		- Light (Very Rare)
		- Dark (Very Rare)
	- Uses Shield of Physical or Magical type to reduce damage while having some restriction on the user (slow movement while shielding, mana usage, stun if shield breaks, etc.)
	- Dodging which will completely negate % damage (depends on how successful the dodge is) which also giving you a counter attack option in some cases (depends on various things, for example a high difference in agility stat between the attacker and defender)
